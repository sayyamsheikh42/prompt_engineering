## Best Practices for AI Product Management

### 1. **Start with Strategic Context**

#### ✅ **Do: Provide Comprehensive Business Context**
```
Create a PRD for a customer success management platform with:

Business Context:
- B2B SaaS company with $50M ARR targeting mid-market clients
- Market opportunity: $2.3B customer success software market growing 25% annually
- Competitive landscape: Gainsight, Totango, Catalyst leading the market
- Problem statement: 73% of mid-market SaaS companies struggle with customer churn due to lack of systematic success management
- Business objectives: Reduce churn by 30%, increase expansion revenue by 50%

Strategic Positioning:
- Target market: Mid-market SaaS companies (100-1000 employees)
- Value proposition: "Affordable customer success management for growing SaaS companies"
- Competitive advantage: AI-powered insights with easy implementation
- Revenue model: Freemium with $99/user/month premium tier
```

#### ❌ **Don't: Start Without Context**
```
Bad: Create a PRD for a customer success tool
Good: Create a PRD for a customer success management platform targeting mid-market SaaS companies who need affordable, AI-powered customer success tools to reduce churn and increase expansion revenue
```

### 2. **Use Data-Driven Insights**

#### ✅ **Do: Include Market Research and Data**
```
Develop a PRD for a mobile fitness app with:

- Key needs: Quick workouts, nutrition tracking, motivation and accountability
- Current solutions: Uses 3-4 different apps, causing fragmentation
- Willingness to pay: $9.99/month for personalized AI coaching

```

#### ❌ **Don't: Make Assumptions Without Data**
```
Bad: Users want better fitness tracking
